I am opening this repository to store codes regarding my undergraduate thesis project. The project is named "Flow analysis around a 3-D hydrofoil using Vortex Latice Method and Vortex Panel Method".
Vortex lattice method/Vortex Panel Method is a numerical method which generates mathematical model using vortex entity (in our case: vortex ring element) of any shaped aero/hydro-foil and calculates lift, drag and corresponding moments and coefficients.
