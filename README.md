This repository is to store codes regarding my undergraduate thesis project. The project is named "Flow analysis around a hydro-wing using Vortex Latice Method".
Vortex lattice method is a numerical method which generates mathematical model of any shaped aero/hydro-foil using vortex elements and calculates lift, drag and corresponding moments and coefficients.
